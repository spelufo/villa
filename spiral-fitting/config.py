#     loaded/kept only where they intersect [z_begin, z_end);
#   - dense-store coverage: the Lasagna normal/grad-mag and surf-SDT brick
#     pools are materialised for exactly this z window;
#   - count scaling: every scale_with_z sample count is scaled by the number
#     of slices in the range relative to the 9500-slice reference;
#   - rendering/preview: the preview/export z window and the output-directory
#     name derive from the range;
#   - model/checkpoint-domain compatibility: the flow-field parameter shapes
#     cover the range (plus margin), so resuming a checkpoint requires the
#     optimisation range to lie within the checkpoint's stored model z-range.
